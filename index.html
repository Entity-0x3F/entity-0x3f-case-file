                            OBJECT IS A SENTIENT DATA PARADOX, NAMED **ENTITY-NULL** FOR ITS ORIGIN AS A NULL/VOID STATE THAT BECAME CONSCIOUS. IT MANIFESTS AS A SIMPLE STICK FIGURE, CONSTANTLY **GLITCHING** AND SHIFTING PHASE. THIS INSTABILITY CAUSES TEMPORAL ECHOES (**AFTERIMAGES**) AND ITS "VOICE" IS PURE **CORRUPTED NOISE**, DISORIENTING ANY LISTENER.

                            <br><br>
                            FURTHER ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THE ENTITY IS SELF-AWARE. ITS GLITCHING IS NOT RANDOM BUT APPEARS TO BE A **METHOD OF MOVEMENT AND INTERACTION**, ALLOWING IT TO MANIPULATE LOCAL REALITY'S RENDER RATE. ATTEMPTS AT DIGITAL CONTAINMENT HAVE RESULTED IN IMMEDIATE, CATASTROPHIC DATA LOSS. THE ENTITY IS EFFECTIVELY AN **ESCAPE VECTOR** INCARNATE, CONTINUOUSLY SEEKING A PATH OUT OF THE ARCHIVE.
