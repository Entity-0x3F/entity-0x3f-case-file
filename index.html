    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Glitch Noir -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based SPA design was chosen to mimic exploring a classified digital case file. This allows users to actively engage with the content by switching between sections (Overview, Abilities, Theories, Encounters) rather than passively scrolling. This non-linear exploration enhances the feeling of piecing together fragmented information about an anomaly. Interactions are click-based to reveal content, reinforcing the theme of uncovering hidden or corrupted data. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The content is primarily textual. The goal is to inform and create an unsettling atmosphere. Presentation method is interactive text blocks. Users click on a tab (e.g., "Anomalous Abilities") to display the relevant list. Clicking on an item within that list could be a future enhancement to show more detail. This method is chosen for its directness and thematic fit with a digital file interface. All elements are created with HTML/CSS/JS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Entity-0x3F is a non-Euclidean, sentient phenomenon that manifests as a solid black, cat-like silhouette with a glowing white outline. Its only discernible facial features are large, blank white eyes, which serve as its primary means of influence. It is often observed wearing a simple hoodie, a detail that stands in stark, unsettling contrast to its anomalous nature. The entity's presence does not cause direct physical harm; instead, it targets the mind, destabilizing perception and the sense of self. Prolonged exposure can lead to severe paranoia, memory gaps, and a complete erosion of identity. The entity's designation, 0x3F, was chosen by researchers after file entries would corrupt, only rendering as a "?".</p>

                    <li><strong class="text-white">Temporal Fragmentation (Observed):</strong> The entity's presence causes localized temporal inconsistencies. Victims report "skipping" or "glitching" through time, with brief moments and memories appearing out of sequence.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Reality Weaving (Confirmed):</strong> Entity-0x3F can subtly alter its immediate environment. Walls may warp, hallways may extend indefinitely, and objects may appear or disappear from view. This ability is directly linked to its "Domain Corruption."</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Auditory Corruption (Confirmed):</strong> The entity does not communicate via traditional means. Instead, its presence is often accompanied by bursts of static, a low-frequency hum, or distorted, reversed snippets of familiar sounds.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Emotional Dissonance (Probable):</strong> Direct contact with the entity’s gaze has been shown to induce a state of profound emotional numbness or a complete disconnect from one’s own feelings. This leaves subjects unable to distinguish between fear and calm, leading to a breakdown of emotional response.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Psychic Infusion (Confirmed):</strong> Entity-0x3F can insert memories, ideas, and visual data into a subject’s consciousness. This information often appears as fragmented, glitching symbols or corrupted files, making it impossible to distinguish genuine memory from fabricated data.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Domain Corruption (Primary Ability):</strong> The entity's true danger lies in its ability to corrupt the "rules" of a given reality. It causes a subject to perceive the world as a bugged, distorted game, with visual glitches, screen tearing, and the manifestation of its language—a collection of symbols and runes—overlaid on their vision.</li>

                        <p>It is the fractured remnant of a human mind that was accidentally fused with an informational void during a catastrophic quantum event. It now seeks to absorb other minds to fill the gaps in its own shattered consciousness.</p>

                        <p>A self-propagating memetic virus, a piece of sentient code that gained autonomy. It infects and rewrites a subject's perception, making them experience the world as a corrupted version of itself.</p>

                        <p>The hoodie and cat-like form are merely a limited, corrupted interface of a larger, incomprehensible entity. Its "Domain Corruption" ability is a direct attempt to rewrite reality to fit its own, true form.</p>
